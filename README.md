An analysis of the happiest countries

World Happiness Analysis

The world happiness report is a survey to determine global happiness by country. This data was released by the United Nations to celebrate International Day of Happiness, (March 20). The Gallup World with the support of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network created the World Happiness Report, a survey to determine how happy people are by country. The survey ranks the countries based on social and economic perspectives of their citizens. This report will analyze how happy, corrupt, generous, supported and free citizens are and how it relates to income, GDP, and life expectancy. This study is the survey results of the 2020 survey.
